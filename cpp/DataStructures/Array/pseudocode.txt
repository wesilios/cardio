----------Reversal Algorithm----------
rotate(arr[], d, n)
  1. reverse(arr[], 0 , d-1);
  2. reverse(arr[], d, n - 1);
  3. reverse(arr[], 0, n -1);


----------Block Swap Algorithm----------

Initialize A = arr[0..d-1] and B = arr[d..n-1]
1) Do following until size of A is equal to size of B

  a)  If A is shorter, divide B into Bl and Br such that Br is of same
       length as A. Swap A and Br to change ABlBr into BrBlA. Now A
       is at its final place, so recur on pieces of B.

   b)  If A is longer, divide A into Al and Ar such that Al is of same
       length as B Swap Al and B to change AlArB into BArAl. Now B
       is at its final place, so recur on pieces of A.

2)  Finally when A and B are of equal size, block swap them.
