# Cardio — Algorithms & Data Structures

Cardio is a personal learning project focused on exploring classic and modern algorithms and data structures,
implemented from scratch in multiple programming languages.

This repository serves as both a learning log and a practical reference for how core concepts are expressed across
different ecosystems.

# Current Implementations

| Language         | 	Status          | 	Location	 | Testing                     |
|------------------|------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| C / C++          | ✅ Active         | /cpp       | Unit tests with Google Test |
| .NET / .NET Core | ✅ Active         | /dotnet    | xUnit test suite            |
| PHP              | 🕐 (coming soon) | /php       | TBD                         |
| Java             | 🕐 (coming soon) | /java      | JUnit (planned)             |

# Project Goals

- Learn and reinforce algorithmic thinking through practical coding.
- Compare performance and syntax differences between languages.
- Build a reusable collection of algorithm implementations for reference and practice.
- Automate build and test pipelines for each language.
